# OPNsense_Firewall_configuration

## Objective

To design and implement a secure network infrastructure using OPNsense, focusing on intrusion detection and prevention with Suricata IDS/IPS, web filtering for content control, and Squid proxy for efficient traffic management and monitoring

### Skills Learned

- Suricata IDS/IPS Installation on Opnsense also wrote a suricata rule for detecting nmap stealth scan.
- Using squid to create a proxy and configuration and also to implement wewb filtering.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Squid
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
